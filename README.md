# Binary-Classification

Binary-Classification is a project in which two binary files are classified by constructing three statistical models from scratch, viz., perceptron, logistic regression, naive bayes classifier. These models are trained on several instances of the two binary files generated randomly, one having a 50% chance of getting zeros and the other having a 70% chance of getting zeros. Each of these models is then tested by feeding input files with varied percentage of zeros like 50%, 70%, 60%, 30%, etc., and checking the category to which the files were classified.
